/*
hese methods are:

peek()
element()
poll()
remove()

The peek() method retrieves the value of the first element of the queue without removing it from the queue. For each invocation of the method we always get the same value and its execution
does not affect the size of the queue. If the queue is empty the peek() method returns null.
The element() method behaves like peek(), so it again retrieves the value of the first element without removing it.
 Unlike peek ), however, if the list is empty element() throws a NoSuchElementException


The poll() method retrieves the value of the first element of the queue by removing it from the queue. .
 At each invocation it removes the first element of the list 
 and if the list is already empty it returns null but does not throw any exception
The remove() method behaves as the poll() method,
 so it removes the first element of the list and if the list
  is empty it throws a NoSuchElementException
